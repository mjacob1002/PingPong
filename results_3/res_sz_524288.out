CharmLB> Load balancer assumes all CPUs are same.
Charm++> cpu affinity enabled. 
Charm++> cpuaffinity PE-core map (logical indices): 0,1
Charm++> Running on 1 hosts (2 sockets x 64 cores x 1 PUs = 128-way SMP)
Charm++> cpu topology info is gathered in 0.003 seconds.
CharmLB> Load balancing instrumentation for communication is off.
