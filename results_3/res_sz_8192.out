Charm++> Level of thread support used: MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED (desired: MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED)
Charm++> Running in SMP mode: 1 processes, 2 worker threads (PEs) + 1 comm threads per process, 2 PEs total
Charm++> The comm. thread both sends and receives messages
Converse/Charm++ Commit ID: v7.1.0-devel-172-ge6d5463bb
CharmLB> Load balancer assumes all CPUs are same.
Charm++> cpu affinity enabled. 
Charm++> cpuaffinity PE-core map (logical indices): 0,1
Charm++> Running on 1 hosts (2 sockets x 64 cores x 1 PUs = 128-way SMP)
Charm++> cpu topology info is gathered in 0.003 seconds.
CharmLB> Load balancing instrumentation for communication is off.
